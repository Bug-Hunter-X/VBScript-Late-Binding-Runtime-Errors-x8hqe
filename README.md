# VBScript Late Binding Runtime Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in VBScript programming: runtime errors caused by late binding.  Late binding, while offering flexibility, can make debugging significantly harder because errors might only appear when a specific object or method is unavailable at runtime.

The `lateBindingBug.vbs` file shows an example of this problem. The `lateBindingSolution.vbs` file provides a solution to improve code clarity and prevent these runtime errors.

**How to reproduce the bug:**
1. Open `lateBindingBug.vbs`.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe the error message when the FileSystemObject is not present.

**Solution:**
The solution utilizes early binding to ensure that the object is correctly referenced at compile time, improving code reliability and maintainability.
